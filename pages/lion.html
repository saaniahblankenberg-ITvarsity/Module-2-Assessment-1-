                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx
                    as a subspecies</p>
                <p>The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia,[3] where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals</p>
                <p>Gemsbok are light brownish-grey to tan in colour, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in colour. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture
                    of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of each side to the blackish section of the rear leg. They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and
                    both genders have long, straight horns.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the lion at pen E21.</p>
